# Automated Road Crash Detection  

## Introduction

Prompt crash detection is essential to reduce incident congestion and increase road safety. To that end, I developed a cost-effective and reliable road crash detection model using XGBoost. The model was trained with the integrated dataset containing traffic, weather, road geometry, solar position, and population density. These data have both a direct and indirect impact on causing crashes, and most of the data are downloaded from the state DOT website. A total of six years crash and non-crash records were processed and used for the model train and test. The dataset for the model train and test includes 30 features and 54,643 observations. 

## Data 

We obtained and processed six years of crash data occurred on NJ Route 3 

- NJ highway crash data


but that's only the start of our
training set for this supervised machine learning problem. We use many different features to try
to differentiate between car accidents occuring or not. These include
