# Road Crash Detection  

## Introduction

Prompt crash detection is essential to reduce incident congestion and increase road safety. Conventional road crash detections have been performed with various Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) devices. However, the deployment of ITS devices along a corridor requires tremendous amount of money and time. To that end, I developed a cost-effective and reliable road crash detection model using XGBoost. The model was trained with the integrated dataset containing traffic, weather, road geometry, solar position, and population density. These data have both a direct and indirect impact on causing crashes, and most of the data are downloaded from the state DOT website. A total of six years crash and non-crash records were processed and used for the model train and test. The dataset for the model train and test includes 30 features and 54,643 observations. 

## Data 

We obtained and processed six years of crash data (occurred on NJ Route 3) and crash related data, including INRIX link speed, road geometry, weather, and population density. 
Below shows the download link.

Note that the weather data was pulled from the [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/quick-links) and the vertical profile was obtained from the Google Earth.


## Data Process & Integration

Data processing of the collected data is shown in [NJ3_Crash_Data_Pre-processing.ipynb](NJ3_Crash_Data_Pre-processing.ipynb).
Then, the processed datasets were merged together by time and location, which is shown in [Join_CrashData_RoadLink_INRIX-TMC.ipynb](Join_CrashData_RoadLink_INRIX-TMC.ipynb)

Overall, the features used for the model training are summarized below.

## Model 

We used [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for the supervised machine
learning model. The model was trained using the following tuned parameters.

- `max_depth` : 6.0
- `min_child_weight`: 5.0
- `reg_lambda`: 1.0
- `reg_alpha` : 0.0
- `scale_pos_weight`: 1.0
- `eval_metric`: auc
- `eta`: 0.5

The model train and test is shown in [XGBoostModeling.ipynb](XGBoostModeling.ipynb)

## SHAP Analysis

With the feature importance analysis, we have more insight into what features contributed, and on what scale, to mapping the test data to an output. A limitation of the feature importance plot is that it does not provide insight into the interactions between features, and it does not show how the results and features are correlated (e.g., negatively or positively). To address the shortcomings of the feature importance analysis, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) was adopted to interpret the output of the trained model. 
Below shows the primary features that affect positively (or negatively) on crash detection.
